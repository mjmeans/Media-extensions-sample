# Media extensions sample

This is an attempt to add Windows Universal projects to the C#/C++ sample published by MS at https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Media-extensions-sample-7b466096

New projects:
- MediaExtension.Universal: A UWP App. This works with the Windows 8.1 Runtime Components in Media Extensions.
- GrayscaleTransform.Universal: An attempt to create a C++ Windows Runtime Component project using the shared code from GrayscaleTransform.Shared project. This Windows Runtime Component doesn't work.

To load and run these projects, you must use Visual Studio 2015.
